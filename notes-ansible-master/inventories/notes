Static and Dynamic Inventories


Static Inventories:
Adding hosts via patterns. Example:
[webserver-group1]
www[01-50].example.com --> include all hosts from 1-50
apacheweb anisble_user=user --> it will use user as an ansible user

## Have a look at the static folder for examples about variables created in static inventories. 
You can use them in ad-hoc commands like this:
ansible -b -i myhost other -a "ls {{log_folder}}"

Dynamic Inventories: JSON format. It must be executable file like with py extention.
Lookup how to use dynamic inventories with Amozon and other Cloud services.

You can create an inventory and playbook to test. Have a look  at the sample dynamic python script  
and install_elinks.yml playbook in dynamic-inventory folder. 
make sure inventory has execute permission and  run this command:

ansible-playbook - /etc/ansible/dynamic.py install _elinks.yml

There are two default groups: all and ungrouped
